# Machine-Learning
The automotive industry plays a pivotal role in our modern society, providing transportation solutions that have become an essential part of our daily lives. 
As the automotive market continually evolves with new technologies and innovations, understanding the factors that influence car prices becomes increasingly important. Car price prediction not only aids consumers in making informed purchase decisions but also serves as a valuable tool for dealerships, manufacturers, and analysts seeking insights into market trends and pricing strategies.

In the realm of data science, predicting car prices presents a fascinating challenge that combines statistical modeling, machine learning techniques, and domain expertise. In this project, we embark on a journey to harness the power of linear regression to create a predictive model that can estimate car prices based on a set of relevant attributes.

Linear regression, a foundational technique in statistics and machine learning, offers a straightforward yet effective approach to modeling the relationship between dependent and independent variables. By applying linear regression to a carefully curated dataset, we aim to uncover the underlying patterns and correlations that contribute to a car's market value.
