# Mathematics Behind Multiple Linear Regression

## Introduction

Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. In this document, we will explore the mathematical foundation of MLR, focusing on two key methods for estimating the coefficients:
-  the Normal Equation 
-  and Gradient Descent.
